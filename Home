* based on <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile">textile</a> and <a href="http://www.walterzorn.com/tooltip/tooltip_e.htm">wz_tooltip.js</a>
* Currently the source is located at <a href="http://git.bobfrank.org/index.php?p=pygitwiki.git">git.bobfrank.org</a>
* useful for organizing thoughts and seeing who's thoughts were organized

* git blame being used for viewing with tooltip for details of who made the most recent change to a line
